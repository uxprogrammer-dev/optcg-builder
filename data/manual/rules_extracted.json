Number of Players\n1-1-1. Fundamentally, this game is intended to be played by two players, head-to-head.\nThese rules do not currently support play by three or more players.\n1-2. Ending the Game\n1-2-1. The game ends when either player loses the game. When a player’s opponent loses\nthe game, the player who has not lost wins the game.\n1-2-1-1. The two defeat conditions are as follows:\n1-2-1-1-1. When you have 0 Life cards and your Leader takes damage.\n1-2-1-1-2. When you have 0 cards in your deck.\n1-2-2. When either player meets a defeat condition, they will lose the game according to\nthe rule processing at the next time of rule processing. (See 9. Rule Processing)\n1-2-2-1. If either player’s Leader takes damage when that player has 0 Life cards\nremaining during the game, that player has met a defeat condition.\n1-2-2-2. If either player has 0 cards in their deck during the game, that player has met\na defeat condition.\n\n2\n1-2-3. Either player may concede at any point during a game. When a player concedes,\nthey lose immediately and the game ends.\n1-2-4. A concession is not affected by any card. Furthermore, concession cannot be\nforced by any card effect, and defeat by concession cannot be replaced by any\nreplacement effect.\n1-2-5. The effects of some cards may cause a player to win or lose the game. In such a\ncase, the player wins or loses during the processing of that effect, and the game\nends.\n1-3. Fundamental Principles\n1-3-1. When card text contradicts the Comprehensive Rules, the card text takes\nprecedence over the Comprehensive Rules.\n1-3-2. If a player is required to perform an impossible action for any reason, that action\nis not carried out. Likewise, if an effect requires the player to carry out multiple\nactions, some of which are impossible, the player performs as many of the actions\nas possible.\n1-3-2-1. If an object is required to change to a given state, and the object is already in\nthat state, the object’s state remains the same, and the action is not performed.\n1-3-2-2. If a player is required to perform an action 0 or a negative number of times\nfor any reason, that action is not carried out. A request to perform a certain\naction negative times does not imply performing its opposite action.\n1-3-3. If a card’s effect requires a player to carry out an action while a currently active\neffect prohibits that action, the prohibiting effect always takes precedence.\n1-3-4. If both players are required to make choices simultaneously for any reason, the\nplayer whose turn it is makes the choices first. After that player has made their\nchoices, the other player makes their choices.\n1-3-5. If a card or rule requires a player to choose a number, unless otherwise specified,\nthe player must choose a whole number of 0 or greater. Players cannot choose\nnumbers containing fractions less than 1, or negative numbers.\n1-3-5-1. If a card or rule specifies a maximum value for a number, such as “up to ...”,\nas long as no minimum number is specified, the player can choose 0.\n1-3-6. If a card effect changes information on a card, unless otherwise specified or defined\nby the rules, numbers on a card cannot contain fractions less than 1. If non-power\nnumbers would become negative, they are treated as 0, except in cases where the\ninformation is added to or subtracted from.\n1-3-6-1. Power can become a negative value.\n1-3-6-1-1. Even if a card’s power becomes a negative value, unless otherwise\n\n3\nspecified, that card will not be trashed or otherwise moved to another\narea.\n1-3-6-2. If the information regarding a cost is being changed by an effect, it may\nbecome a negative value only for the duration of that calculation. Outside of\nsuch calculations, the cost of a card whose value becomes negative is treated\nas being 0.\n1-3-6-2-1. If a card whose cost is already negative would have its cost further\nincreased or decreased by an effect, that negative value is included in\nthose calculations.\n1-3-7. Unless otherwise specified, card effects are carried out in the order described on\nthe card.\n1-3-8. If card effects require a player to rest a card and set it as active simultaneously, the\neffect requiring the player to rest the card always takes precedence.\n1-3-9. Cost and Activation Cost\n1-3-9-1. Cost refers to a payment that must be made to play a card. A card’s cost is the\nnumber written in its upper left corner. (See 6-5-3-1.)\n1-3-9-2. Activation cost refers to a payment required to activate a card’s effect. (See 8-\n3.)\n1-3-10. If both players are instructed to perform some action at the same time according\nto a card’s effect, the turn player is to perform the action first, followed by the\nnon-turn player.\n2. Card Information\n2-1. Card Name\n2-1-1. This is the card’s fixed name.\n2-1-2. Some text will include text in [ ] brackets without a clarifying noun afterwards.\nThis refers to cards with the card name specified in the [ ] brackets.\n2-1-2-1. Some text will include part of a card name in \" \" quotation marks. This text\nrefers to cards with a card name containing the text in the quotation marks.\n2-1-3. As an exception, some cards get card names from their text. Treat these cards as\nif they have this name by default, including during deck construction and when in\nsecret areas.\n2-2. Card Category\n2-2-1. This specifies the card’s category.\n2-2-2. There are five card categories: Leader card, Character card, Event card, Stage card,\nand DON!! card.\n\n4\n2-2-3. Cards in the Leader card category are placed in the Leader area.\n2-2-3-1. When a card’s text refers to “Leader” or “Leader card”, this means a card in\nthe Leader card category placed in the Leader area.\n2-2-4. Cards in the Character card category are placed in the Character area.\n2-2-4-1. When a card’s text refers to “Character”, this means a card in the Character\ncard category placed in the Character area.\n2-2-4-2. When a card’s text refers to “Character card”, this means a card in the\nCharacter card category that is located outside of the Character area.\n2-2-4-3. When a card’s text refers to “Leader and/or Character cards”, the latter means\na card in the Character card category placed in the Character area.\n2-2-5. Cards in the Event card category can have their effects activated by the card being\nmoved from the player’s hand to the trash.\n2-2-5-1. When a card’s text refers to “Event” or “Event card”, this means a card in the\nEvent card category.\n2-2-6. Cards in the Stage card category are placed in the Stage area.\n2-2-6-1. When a card’s text refers to “Stage”, this means a card in the Stage card\ncategory.\n2-2-6-2.

In the hexagon, the upper right is red, the right is green, the lower right is\nblue, the lower left is purple, the left is black, and the upper left is yellow.\n2-3-4. Some cards have multiple colors, such as red and blue, or green and purple.\n2-3-5. Cards with multiple colors, such as red and green, are treated as a card of every\ncolor they possess.\n2-3-6. Cards with multiple colors are sometimes referred to as “multicolor” in card text.\n2-4. Type\n2-4-1. This specifies the card’s types. It may be referenced in card text.\n2-4-2. Some cards may have multiple types. Where a card has multiple types, each type\nwill be separated by a slash (/).\n2-4-3. Some text will include text in { } brackets. This refers to cards with the type\nspecified in the { } brackets.\n\n5\n2-4-3-1. Some text will include part of a type in \" \" quotation marks. This text refers to\ncards with a type containing the text in the quotation marks.\n2-4-4. As an exception, some cards get types from their text. Treat these cards as if they\nhave this type by default, including during deck construction and when in secret\nareas.\n2-5. Attribute\n2-5-1. This specifies the card’s attribute. It may be referenced in card text.\n2-5-2. There are six attributes: Slash, Strike, Ranged, Special, Wisdom, and “?”.\n2-5-3. Some cards have multiple attributes, such as Slash and Strike, or Ranged and\nSpecial.\n2-5-4. If a card has multiple attributes, such as Slash and Strike, it is treated as a card\nwith all the attributes it possesses.\n2-5-5. Only Leader cards and Character cards have attributes.\n2-5-6. Some text will include text in < > brackets. This refers to cards with the attribute\nspecified in the < > brackets.\n2-5-7. As an exception, some cards get attributes from their text.

Card Attacks and Battles)\n2-6-2. Only Leader cards and Character cards have power.\n2-6-3. An effect may make a power value greater or less than the written value.\n2-7. Cost\n2-7-1. This specifies the cost needed to play the card from your hand. (See 6-5-3-1.)\n2-7-2. When playing a Character card from your hand, you should first reveal the card\nyou wish to play, select a number of active DON!! cards in your cost area equal to\nthe card’s cost, rest those DON!! cards, and then play the revealed card.\n2-7-3. When activating an Event card from your hand, you should first reveal the card\nyou wish to activate, select a number of active DON!! cards in your cost area equal\nto the card’s cost, rest those DON!! cards, and then trash the revealed card to\nactivate it.\n2-7-4. When playing a Stage card from your hand, you should first reveal the card you\nwish to play, select a number of active DON!! cards in your cost area equal to the\ncard’s cost, rest those DON!! cards, and then play the revealed card.\n2-7-5.

This describes the card’s effects.\n2-8-2. Unless otherwise specified, card text on Leader cards, Character cards, and Stage\ncards is valid only in the Leader area, Character area, and Stage area, respectively.\n2-8-3. Text is resolved in order starting from the text closest to the top.\n2-8-4. Some text has detailed explanations of keyword effects or other card effects inside\n( ) parentheses. These are called explanatory notes and their purpose is to provide\nfurther explanation of effects.\n2-8-4-1. Explanatory notes do not influence gameplay.\n2-8-4-2. As an exception, some effect text may be included in parentheses to make the\neffect easier to understand.\n2-8-5. A card without card text may be described in text as having “no base effect”.\n2-9. Life\n2-9-1. This specifies the Life value of a Leader card.\n2-9-2.

Illustration\n2-16-1. This is the card’s illustration inspired by its contents. It does not affect gameplay.\n2-17. Illustrator’s Name\n2-17-1. This is the name of the illustrator who created the card’s illustration. It does not\naffect gameplay.\n3. Game Areas\n3-1. Areas\n3-1-1. The areas are the deck, DON!! deck, hand, trash, Leader area, Character area,\nStage area, cost area, and Life area.\n3-1-2. The Leader area, Character area, Stage area, and cost area are sometimes\ncollectively referred to as “the field”.\n3-1-3. Unless otherwise specified, each player possesses one of every area.\n3-1-4. The number of cards in each area is open information that can be confirmed by\nboth players at any time.\n3-1-5. Cards in some areas are revealed to both players while others are not. Areas with\nrevealed cards are called open areas, while areas with hidden cards are called secret\nareas.\n3-1-6. When a card is moved from the Character area or Stage area to another area, unless\notherwise specified, the card is treated as a new card in a new area. Effects that\nwere applied to the card in the original area are not carried over to the new area.\n3-1-6-1. When a DON!! card moves from one area to another, all effects that were\npreviously applied to that DON!! card are removed.\n3-1-7. When multiple cards are placed in an area simultaneously, unless otherwise\nspecified, the owner of the cards decides the order in which they are placed in the\nnew area.\n3-1-8. When multiple cards are placed from an open area in a secret area simultaneously,\nif the owner of the cards can determine the order the cards are placed in, the other\nplayer cannot confirm the order in which the cards are placed.\n3-2. Deck\n3-2-1. Each player places their deck here at the start of the game.\n3-2-2. The deck is a secret area. Cards in this area are placed face-down in a stack and,\n\n8\nunless otherwise specified, neither player can check the contents or order of those\ncards, nor can they change their order.\n3-2-3. When multiple cards in a deck are moved simultaneously, they should be moved\none by one.\n3-2-4. When a player is instructed to shuffle a deck, the player will randomly change the\norder of cards in that deck.\n3-3. DON!! Deck\n3-3-1. Each player places their DON!! deck here at the start of the game.\n3-3-2. The DON!! deck is an open area. Cards in this area are placed face-down in a stack,\nand both players can freely view the contents and order of these cards, and change\ntheir order.\n3-3-3. When multiple DON!! cards in a DON!! deck are moved simultaneously, they\nshould be moved one by one.\n3-4. Hand\n3-4-1. This is where each player places the cards they draw from their deck.\n3-4-2. The hand is a secret area, but a player can freely view the contents and change the\norder of cards in their hand.\n3-4-3. Players cannot view the contents of cards in the other player’s hand unless\notherwise specified.\n3-5. Trash\n3-5-1. Character cards that have been K.O.’d and Event cards that have been activated\nare placed in this area.\n3-5-2. The trash is an open area. Cards in this area are placed face-up in a stack, and\neither player can freely view the contents and order of these cards. Players may\nfreely change the order of cards in their own trash. When placing new cards in\nthis area, they are normally placed on top of the cards that are already there.\n3-6. Leader Area\n3-6-1. Each player places their Leader card face-up in this area at the start of the game.\n3-6-2. The Leader area is an open area.\n3-6-3. A card placed in the Leader area which is treated as a Leader card cannot be moved\nfrom the Leader area by card effects or rules and will remain in the Leader area.\n3-7. Character Area\n3-7-1. This is where each player places their Character cards.\n3-7-2. The Character area is an open area. Cards in this area are placed face-up.\n3-7-3. Placing a Character card in the Character area is called “play[ing]” that card.\n3-7-4. Played cards cannot attack on the turn in which they are played unless otherwise\n\n9\nspecified.\n3-7-5. When placing cards in the Character area, they should be set as active unless\notherwise specified.\n3-7-6. Up to 5 Character cards can be placed in the Character area.\n3-7-6-1. If there are 5 Character cards in the Character area and a player wants to play\na new Character card, that player should reveal the card they want to play, trash\n1 of the Character cards already in their Character area, and then play the new\nCharacter card in the Character area.\n3-7-6-1-1. Trashing a Character according to 3-7-6-1. is treated as processing a rule,\nand no effect can be applied.\n3-8. Stage Area\n3-8-1. This is where each player places their Stage cards.\n3-8-2. The Stage area is an open area. Cards in this area are placed face-up.\n3-8-3. Placing a Stage card in the Stage area is called “play[ing]” that card.\n3-8-4. When placing cards in the Stage area, they should be set as active unless otherwise\nspecified.\n3-8-5. Up to 1 Stage card can be placed in the Stage area.\n3-8-5-1. If there is 1 Stage card in the Stage area and a player wants to play a new Stage\ncard, that player should reveal the card they want to play, trash the 1 Stage\ncard already in their Stage area, and then play the new Stage card in the Stage\narea.\n3-9. Cost Area\n3-9-1. DON!! cards are placed in this area.\n3-9-2. The cost area is an open area. Either player can freely view the contents of these\ncards. Players may freely change the order of cards in their own cost area. When\npaying a cost, players may freely choose which cards to use.\n3-9-3. When placing DON!! cards in the cost area, they should be set as active unless\notherwise specified.\n3-10. Life Area\n3-10-1. The Life cards for a player’s Leader are placed in this area.\n3-10-2. The Life area is a secret area. Cards in this area are, unless otherwise specified,\nplaced face-down in a stack and neither player can check the contents of those\ncards, nor can they change their order. When moving a card from their Life area\nto another area, a player must select the card at the top of their Life cards unless\notherwise specified.\n3-10-2-1. An effect may cause a card to be added to the Life area face-up. In such a\n\n10\ncase, the face-up card is treated as a card in an open area as an exception.\n3-10-3. Effects that refer to looking at Life cards can be processed regardless of whether\nthe Life cards are face-up or face-down. After such an effect is processed, the Life\ncards should be placed as they were before the effect was processed (i.e., face-up\nor face-down).\n4. Basic Game Terminology\n4-1. Effects\n4-1-1. Effects are specified in card text.\n4-1-2. Keyword effects, such as [Activate: Main], [Blocker], [Counter], and [Trigger],\nare found in effects. (See 10-1.)\n4-2. Player\n4-2-1. “Player” refers to the person who possesses a card.\n4-2-1-1. When a card’s text refers to “owner”, this means the original holder of the\ncard.\n4-2-2. At the end of the game, each player has all cards they own returned to them.\n4-3. Turn Player and Non-Turn Player\n4-3-1. The “turn player” is the player whose turn is currently in progress.\n4-3-2. The “non-turn player” is the player whose turn is currently not in progress.\n4-4. Card States\n4-4-1. Cards in the Leader area, Character area, Stage area, and cost area should be in\none of the following two states:\n4-4-1-1. Active: A card positioned vertically from the player’s point of view.\n4-4-1-2. Rested: A card positioned horizontally from the player’s point of view.\n4-4-2. As an exception, given DON!! cards are neither active nor rested.\n4-5. Draw a Card\n4-5-1. “Draw a card” is the act of adding the top card of a deck to your hand without\nrevealing it to the other player.\n4-5-2. When directed to “draw 1 card”, add 1 card from the top of your deck to your hand\nwithout revealing it to the other player.\n4-5-3. When directed to “draw X cards”, nothing happens if X is 0. If X is 1 or higher,\nrepeat the “draw a card” process that many times.\n4-5-4. When directed to “draw up to X card(s)”, nothing happens if X is 0. If X is 1 or\nhigher, carry out the following actions:\n4-5-4-1. You can end this action.\n4-5-4-2. Draw 1 card.\n\n11\n4-5-4-3. If you have carried out 4-5-4-2 X times, end this action. If not, return to 4-5-\n4-1.\n4-6. Damage Processing\n4-6-1. The act of dealing damage is referred to as “damage processing”.\n4-6-2. If any action deals damage to a Leader, the player whose Leader has taken damage\nwill perform the following procedure:\n4-6-2-1. If the damage taken is 1, the player whose Leader has taken damage moves 1\ncard from the top of their Life cards to their hand.\n4-6-2-2. If the damage received is X, nothing happens if X is 0. If X is 1 or higher, the\nplayer repeats the “If the damage taken is 1” process (4-6-2-1) that many\ntimes.\n4-6-3. If a card with [Trigger] is added to the player’s hand from their Life area during\nthis procedure, the player can choose to activate that [Trigger]. (See 10-1-5.)\n4-6-3-1. If a Life card cannot be added to the hand due to an effect or replacement\neffect, the [Trigger] cannot be activated.\n4-7. Play a Card\n4-7-1. Playing a card refers to a player paying its cost and activating it or playing it from\ntheir hand.\n4-7-2. When a card cannot be played, this means a player cannot pay its cost and activate\nit or play it from their hand.\n4-8. Up to X Card(s)\n4-8-1. If a direction states “up to X card(s)”, when the effect is activated, choose between\n0 and X cards immediately before the effect is processed. Then, resolve the effect.\n4-8-2. “Draw up to X card(s)” is an exception processed according to 4-5-4.\n4-9. “Base”\n4-9-1. The term “base” appears in some card text.\n4-9-2. “Base” refers to the number or card text as it appears on that card.\n4-9-2-1. If there are several effects that set a base power to a certain value, and those\neffects all affect the same card, if the values differ, apply the effect with the\nhighest value.\n4-9-2-2. If there are several effects that set a base cost to a certain value, and those\neffects all affect the same card, if the values differ, apply the effect with the\nhighest value.\n4-10. “If” and “Then”\n4-10-1. If a preceding “if” clause in the text cannot be resolved, the following clause in\nthat text also cannot be resolved.\n\n12\n4-10-2. If a preceding “then” clause in the text cannot be resolved, the following clause\nin that text can still be resolved.\n4-11. “Remove”\n4-11-1. The term “remove” appears in some card text.\n4-11-2. “Remove” refers to moving a card from the area it is placed in to another area.\n5. Game Setup\n5-1. Preparing Leader Cards, Decks, and DON!! Decks\n5-1-1. Each player prepares a Leader card, deck, and DON!! deck from their cards before\nthe game begins.\n5-1-2. Each player needs exactly 1 Leader card, a 50-card deck, and a 10-card DON!!\ndeck to play.\n5-1-2-1. A deck is a bundle of cards made up of Character cards, Event cards, and Stage\ncards.\n5-1-2-2. Only cards of a color included on the Leader card can be included in a deck.\nCards of a color not included on the Leader card cannot be added to the deck.\n5-1-2-3. A deck can contain no more than 4 cards with the same card number.\n5-1-2-4. Effects related to deck construction rules are treated as permanent effects (see\n8-1-3-4-3.) which replace the deck construction rules above.\n5-1-2-4-1. Effects related to deck construction are those specifying that the deck can\ncontain a specified number of cards of a certain category, or that the deck\ncannot contain a specified number of cards of a certain category.\n5-1-2-4-2. Effects related to deck construction are valid during deck construction.\n5-2. Pre-Game Preparations\n5-2-1. Before playing the game, each player must follow the procedure below:\n5-2-1-1. Each player presents the deck they’re going to use in this game. This deck (at\nthis time) must meet the deck construction rules specified in 5-1-2.\n5-2-1-2. Each player thoroughly shuffles their deck. Then, each player places their deck\nface-down in their deck area.\n5-2-1-3. Each player places their Leader card face-up in their Leader area.\n5-2-1-4. The players decide, by Rock-Paper-Scissors or some other means, which\nplayer will decide whether they want to go first or second.\n5-2-1-4-1. No intervention of any kind is allowed in the player’s decision whether to\ngo first or second.\n5-2-1-5. Once it is determined which player will decide whether to go first or second,\nthat player declares whether they will go first or second.\n\n13\n5-2-1-5-1. If a Leader has an effect that reads “At the start of the game”, that effect\nis processed at this time. If there are multiple effects that read “At the\nstart of the game”, the player who chose to go first or second processes\ntheir effects first, in any order, followed by the player who did not choose\nto go first or second, who then processes their effects in any order.\n5-2-1-5-2. If changes are made to a deck as the result of an effect that reads “At the\nstart of the game”, it is then shuffled by the owner of that deck.\n5-2-1-6. Each player draws 5 cards from their deck as their opening hand. Then,\nbeginning with the player going first, each player may redraw their hand once\naccording to the procedure below.\n5-2-1-6-1. The player returns all of the cards in their hand to their deck, reshuffles,\nand then redraws 5 cards.\n5-2-1-7. Each player places a number of cards from the top of their deck equal to the\nLife value of their Leader face-down in their Life area such that the card at the\ntop of their deck is at the bottom in their Life area.\n5-2-1-8. The first player begins the game and starts their turn.\n6. Game Progression\n6-1. Turn Flow\n6-1-1. A “turn” refers to a sequence consisting of a Refresh Phase, Draw Phase, DON!!\nPhase, Main Phase, and End Phase.\n6-1-2. The game is progressed by one of the players serving as the turn player. The turn\nplayer performs the phases following the procedures below.\n6-2. Refresh Phase\n6-2-1. Currently applied effects that last “until the start of your next turn” end.\n6-2-2. Your own and your opponent’s effects that read “at the start of your/your\nopponent’s turn” activate.\n6-2-3. Return all DON!! cards given to cards in your Leader area and Character area (see\n6-5-5-1.) to your cost area and rest them.\n6-2-4. Set all rested cards placed in your Leader area, Character area, Stage area, and cost\narea as active.\n6-3. Draw Phase\n6-3-1. The turn player draws 1 card from their deck. Note that the player going first does\nnot draw a card on their first turn.\n6-4. DON!! Phase\n6-4-1. Place 2 DON!! cards from the DON!! deck face-up in the cost area. Note that the\n\n14\nplayer going first places only 1 DON!! card face-up in their cost area on their first\nturn.\n6-4-2. If there is only 1 card in the DON!! deck, place 1 DON!! card face-up in the cost\narea.\n6-4-3. If there are 0 cards in the DON!! deck, do not place a DON!! card in the cost area.\n6-5. Main Phase\n6-5-1. Your own and your opponent’s effects that read “at the start of the Main Phase”\nactivate.\n6-5-2. In the Main Phase, you may perform the following Main Phase actions: “6-5-3.\nPlay a Card”, “6-5-4. Activate a Card’s Effect”, “6-5-5. Give DON!! Cards”, and\n“6-5-6. Battle”. You can perform these actions in any order and as many times as\nyou wish.\n6-5-2-1. On declaring the end of the Main Phase, proceed to “6-6. End Phase”.\n6-5-3. Play a Card\n6-5-3-1. You can pay the cost and play a Character card or Stage card, or activate an\nEvent card marked with [Main] from your hand. You can perform these\nactions in any order and as many times as you wish.\n6-5-4. Activate a Card’s Effect\n6-5-4-1. The turn player can activate effects marked with [Main] or [Activate: Main].\n6-5-5. Give DON!! Cards\n6-5-5-1. Place 1 active DON!! card from your cost area underneath your Leader or a\nCharacter card in the cost area such that it remains visible. This is called\n“giving”.\n6-5-5-2. Leader cards and Character cards gain 1000 power during your turn for each\nDON!! card given to them.\n6-5-5-3. Giving can be performed as many times as you wish to the extent possible.\n6-5-5-4. When a card that has been given a DON!! card is moved to another area, all\nDON!! cards given to that card are placed in the cost area and rested.\n6-5-6. Battle\n6-5-6-1. Neither player can battle on their first turn.\n6-5-6-2. For more information on battles, please refer to “7. Card Attacks and Battles”\nbelow.\n6-6. End Phase\n6-6-1. This is the phase in which various end-of-turn processes are carried out.\n6-6-1-1. Auto effects that read “[End of Your Turn]” (Keyword) and “[End of Your\nOpponent’s Turn]” (Keyword) are activated.\n\n15\n6-6-1-1-1. Auto effects that read “[End of Your Turn]” (Keyword) and “[End of\nYour Opponent’s Turn]” (Keyword) can only be activated and resolved once.\n6-6-1-1-2. After all “[End of Your Turn]” (Keyword) effects have been activated\nand resolved, all “[End of Your Opponent’s Turn]” (Keyword) effects are\nactivated and resolved.\n6-6-1-1-3. If there are multiple “[End of Your Turn]” (Keyword) effects to be\nresolved, the turn player may activate and resolve them in any order.\n6-6-1-1-4. If there are multiple “[End of Your Opponent’s Turn]” (Keyword)\neffects to be resolved, the non-turn player may activate and resolve them in\nany order.\n6-6-1-2. After all processing that is to be carried out at this time has been\ncompleted, any remaining effects are processed in the following order:\n(1) Process any continuous effects of the turn player that have been activated\nand resolved, but are only due to be processed “at the end of this turn” or\n“at the end of your turn”. The turn player’s effects that last “until the end\nof the turn” and “until the end of the End Phase” become invalid. If there\nare multiple such processes, the turn player may process them in any\norder.\n(2) Process any continuous effects of the non-turn player that have been\nactivated and resolved, but are only due to be processed “at the end of\nthis turn” or “at the end of your opponent’s turn”. The non-turn player’s\neffects that last “until the end of the turn” and “until the end of the End\nPhase” become invalid. If there are multiple such processes, the non-turn\nplayer may process them in any order.\n6-6-1-3. After all processing in 6-6-1-2 has been completed, the turn player’s effects\nthat last “during this turn” become invalid. If there are multiple such processes, the\nturn player may process them in any order. Then, any of the non-turn player’s effects\nthat last “during this turn” become invalid. If there are multiple such processes, the\nnon-turn player may process them in any order.\n6-6-1-4. The turn ends, the non-turn player becomes the new turn player, and the\ngame proceeds to the Refresh Phase of the next turn.\n7. Card Attacks and Battles\n7-1. During the Main Phase, the turn player can rest an active Leader card in their Leader\narea, or an active Character card in their Character area, to attack an opponent’s Leader\ncard in their Leader area, or rested Character card in their Character area. When an\n\n16\nattack is made, the game proceeds to Battle (see 6-5-6.) and is processed in order from\nthe Attack Step (see 7-1-1.) to the Damage Step (see 7-1-4.).\n7-1-1. Attack Step\n7-1-1-1. Attacks are carried out by the Leader card, or a Character card in the\nCharacter area. First, the turn player declares their attack by resting their\nactive Leader card or 1 active Character card.\n7-1-1-2. The turn player then selects the target of their attack. The target can be either\nthe opponent’s Leader card or 1 of their rested Character cards in their\nCharacter area.\n7-1-1-3. Effects that read [When Attacking], “when you attack”, or [On Your\nOpponent's Attack] activate.\n7-1-1-4. If, at the end of the Attack Step, the attacking card or the target card for the\nattack has moved areas due to some method, proceed not to the Block Step\n(see 7-1-2.), but to the End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.).\n7-1-2. Block Step\n7-1-2-1. The player being attacked can activate the [Blocker] effect of their card only\nonce during that battle.\n7-1-2-2. When a [Blocker] is activated, effects that read [On Block] or “when you block”\nactivate.\n7-1-2-3. If, at the end of the Block Step, the attacking card or the target card for the\nattack has moved areas due to some method, proceed not the Counter Step\n(see 7-1-3.), but to the End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.).\n7-1-3. Counter Step\n7-1-3-1. Effects of the player being attacked that read “when attacked” activate.\n7-1-3-2. The player being attacked may perform the following actions in any order and\nas many times as they wish:\n7-1-3-2-1. Activate [(Symbol) Counter]: The player being attacked may trash a\nCharacter card with [(Symbol) Counter] from their hand to activate an\neffect that increases the power of their Leader or 1 Character card by the\nvalue of the [(Symbol) Counter] during that battle.\n7-1-3-2-2. Activate an Event card: The player being attacked may pay the cost of an\nEvent card with [Counter] in their hand, and then trash it to activate the\n[Counter] effect.\n7-1-2-3. If, at the end of the Counter Step, the attacking card or the target card for\nthe attack has moved areas due to some method, proceed not to the Damage\nStep (see 7-1-4.), but to the End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.).\n\n17\n7-1-4. Damage Step\n7-1-4-1. Compare the power of the attacking card and the card being attacked. If the\npower of the attacking card is greater than or equal to the power of the card\nbeing attacked, the battle is won, and the result is either 7-1-4-1-1. or 7-1-4-\n1-2., depending on the category of the card being attacked.\n7-1-4-1-1. If a Leader card: 1 damage is dealt to that Leader.\n7-1-4-1-1-1. If the opponent has 0 Life at the point when it is determined that\ndamage will be dealt, the attacking player wins the game.\n7-1-4-1-1-2. If the opponent has 1 or more Life at the point when it is determined\nthat damage will be dealt, the opponent adds the card at the top of\ntheir Life cards to their hand. At this time, if a card with [Trigger] is\nadded to the opponent’s hand from their Life area, the opponent may\nchoose to reveal the card and activate its [Trigger] instead of adding\nit to their hand (see 10-1-5.).\n7-1-4-1-1-3. If the damage taken is 2 or more due to an effect such as [Double\nAttack], repeat 7-1-4-1-1-2. a number of times equal to the amount\nof damage.\n7-1-4-1-2. If a Character card: That Character card is K.O.’d (see 10-2-1.). Then,\nproceed to End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.).\n7-1-4-2. If the power of the attacking card is less than the power of the card being\nattacked, the attacking card will lose the battle, and nothing will happen during\nthat battle. Then, proceed to the End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.).\n7-1-5. End of the Battle\n7-1-5-1. The battle ends.\n7-1-5-2. Your own and your opponent’s effects that read “at the end of the/this battle”\nor “if this ... battles” activate.\n7-1-5-3. The turn player’s effects that last “during this battle” become invalid.\n7-1-5-4. The non-turn player’s effects that last “during this battle” become invalid.\n7-1-5-5. The battle ends and the game returns to 6-5-2.\n8. Activating and Resolving Effects\n8-1. Effects\n8-1-1. “Effect” refers to a command issued by the text of a card and its cost.\n8-1-2. Effects may include words indicating choice, such as “can” and “may”. Where such\na word is included, players may choose not to activate the relevant effect. Where\nno such word is included, the effect must always be activated and processed to the\n\n18\nextent possible.\n8-1-3. Effects generally fall into one of four categories: “auto effects”, “activate effects”,\n“permanent effects”, and “replacement effects”.\n8-1-3-1. “Auto effects” always activate once automatically when the activation event\ndescribed in the text occurs during the game. If the same event occurs again,\nthe effect automatically activates again as many times as the event occurs,\nunless otherwise specified.\n8-1-3-1-1. Auto effects may be described in card text as [On Play], [When\nAttacking], [On Block], [On K.O.], [End of Your Turn], and [End of Your\nOpponent’s Turn]. In the case of other descriptions such as “when ...” and\n“on ...”, these effects are still categorized as auto effects.\n8-1-3-1-2. Some auto effects require an activation cost and/or the fulfillment of\nconditions.\n8-1-3-1-3. An auto effect will not activate and cannot be resolved even if the\nactivation timing is fulfilled if the card that fulfilled the activation timing of\nthat auto effect moves to another area before that effect is activated.\n8-1-3-2. “Activate effects” can be declared and activated by the turn player during their\nMain Phase (see 6-5-4.).\n8-1-3-2-1. Activate effects may be described in card text as [Activate: Main] or\n[Main].\n8-1-3-2-2. Some activate effects require an activation cost and/or the fulfillment of\nconditions.\n8-1-3-3. “Permanent effects” constantly affect gameplay in some way while they are\nvalid.\n8-1-3-3-1. Permanent effects may be those effects that, based on the card text,\ncannot be classified as auto, activate, or replacement effects, but can be\nclassified as permanent effects.\n8-1-3-3-2. Some permanent effects require the fulfillment of conditions for their\neffect to be valid.\n8-1-3-3-3. Some permanent effects read “according to/under the rules”. In this case,\nthe effect is valid and continues to affect gameplay even when the card is\nin a secret area.\n8-1-3-3-4. “Permanent effects” constantly affect gameplay in some way while they\nare valid.\n8-1-3-3-5. If a permanent effect changes its own impact on the game or that of\nanother permanent effect while it is being applied, due to that permanent\n\n19\neffect itself or another permanent effect, the following order is used to\nprocess the changes, taking into account any continuous effects that have\nalready been resolved:\nI. The turn player processes their permanent effects in any order.\nII. The non-turn player processes their permanent effects in any order.\nIII. If steps I and II change the game's state further, repeat the process until no\nfurther changes occur.\n8-1-3-4. “Replacement effects” are those effects that are denoted by the word “instead”.\n8-1-3-4-1. If a replacement is available but you choose not to apply the replacement,\nthe replacement effect will not be resolved.\n8-1-3-4-2. If more than one replacement effect could apply to replace a situation,\nthe replacement effect of the card that generated that replacement effect\ntakes precedence, followed by the replacement effects of the turn player\nin the order chosen by that player. Then, the non-turn player may apply\ntheir replacement effects in the order they choose.\n8-1-3-4-3. Once an individual process or situation has been replaced by any\nsequence of replacements, the same replacement effects cannot be\napplied to it again repeatedly.\n8-1-3-4-4. A replacement effect applies to replace the entire part of the processing\nof an effect indicated by the replacement effect, even if the processing of\nthat effect is still in progress.\n8-1-3-4-4-1. If an effect is applied in order starting from the text closest to the top\nand a replacement effect is applied in the middle of that text, the\nremaining text is carried out in order after the replacement effect is\napplied.\n8-1-3-4-5. If it is not possible to carry out the replacement effect specified by\n“instead”, that replacement effect cannot be applied.\n8-1-3-4-6. If the conditions to activate another replacement effect are fulfilled as a\nresult of activating a replacement effect, that other replacement effect can\nbe activated.\n8-1-3-4-7. The part of an effect where a replacement effect has been applied is\ntreated as an effect that was activated by the owner of that replacement\neffect.\n8-1-4. Effects can be one-shot effects or continuous effects.\n8-1-4-1. One-shot effects refer to effects that affect the game at the moment they are\nresolved and complete their processing immediately.\n\n20\n8-1-4-2. Continuous effects refer to effects that continue to affect the game for a\nspecified duration.\n8-2. Valid and Invalid Effects\n8-2-1. Some effects may render specific effects valid or invalid. In this case, process the\neffect according to the rules below:\n8-2-1-1. If it is specified that an effect is partially or totally invalid under specific\nconditions, the invalid effect will not occur. If that effect requires a choice, the\nchoice will not be made. If that effect has an activation cost, that cost cannot\nbe paid.\n8-2-1-2. If it is specified that an effect is partially or totally valid only under specific\nconditions, that part is invalid if those conditions are not fulfilled.\n8-2-2. Cards with invalid effects are not treated as cards with “no base effect”.\n8-2-3. Auto effects or activate effects that have already been activated and resolved are\nnot invalidated by other effects.\n8-2-4. If a card with an effect that has been invalidated gains a new effect, that effect is\nnot invalidated unless otherwise indicated.\n8-3. Activation Cost and Conditions\n8-3-1. An effect may specify that the action before the : colon must be taken. This is\nreferred to as the effect’s activation cost.\n8-3-1-1. If there are multiple actions in one activation cost, they are to be carried out\nin order starting from the text closest to the top.\n8-3-1-2. Then, if activation costs are added by other effects, these are to be carried out\nin the order for resolving those effects.\n8-3-1-3. If it is not possible to pay some or all of the activation cost, the activation cost\nto activate the effect cannot be paid at all.\n8-3-1-3-1. If you have fulfilled the conditions to pay the activation cost, activated the\neffect, and become unable to pay the activation cost while in the process\nof paying the activation cost, pay as much of the activation cost as possible.\nYou cannot resolve the effect as written after the : colon. In addition, see\n10-2-13-5. regarding the processing of [Once Per Turn] effects in this\nsituation.\n8-3-1-4. Activation costs may be specified using “can” or “may”. The player can choose\nnot to pay the activation cost; however, this will mean the effect cannot be\nactivated.\n8-3-1-5. Activation costs may be specified using a symbol such as ①. That symbol\nmeans that the player must select a number of active DON!! cards equal to the\n\n21\nnumber in the symbol from their cost area and rest them.\n8-3-1-6. Activation costs may be specified using a symbol such as “DON!! －X”. This\nmeans that the player must select a total number of DON!! cards equal to the\nvalue of X from their Leader area, Character area, and cost area, and return\nthem to their DON!! deck.\n8-3-1-7. Where an activation cost is replaced according to an effect, it is possible to\ncarry out the replacement processing instead of paying the activation cost. If\nthe activation cost is not paid as described in the text, the effect following the :\ncolon will not be processed.\n8-3-1-8. Effect text may include text such as “when...”. This is referred to as the\nactivation timing of that effect. Some keywords also have activation timing.\n8-3-2. Effect text may include text such as [DON!! xX], [Your Turn], and [Opponent’s\nTurn]. This is referred to as the effect’s condition.\n8-3-2-1. If there are multiple conditions in one effect, all of the conditions must be\nfulfilled.\n8-3-2-2. If other conditions are added by another effect, all of those conditions must\nalso be fulfilled.\n8-3-2-3. Conditions may be specified using [DON!! xX]. This condition is met when\nthe number of DON!! cards given to this card is equal to or greater than the\nvalue of X.\n8-3-2-4. Conditions may be specified using [Your Turn]. This condition is met during\nyour turn.\n8-3-2-5. Conditions may be specified using [Opponent’s Turn]. This condition is met\nduring your opponent’s turn.\n8-3-3. Effect text may include “if...”. So long as that clause is not fulfilled, effects after\nthe “if” clause will not be resolved.\n8.4. Activation and Resolution\n8-4-1. To activate an effect, follow the procedure below:\n8-4-1-1. If there are conditions for activation, those conditions must be met. The effect\ncannot be activated if the conditions are not met.\n8-4-1-2. Specify the effect to be activated. If it is an effect of a card in your hand, reveal\nthat card.\n8-4-1-3. If there are activation costs required to activate that effect, determine the\nactivation costs and pay all activation costs.\n8-4-1-4. Activate the effect.\n8-4-1-5. Resolve the effect.\n\n22\n8-4-2. When activating the effect of an Event card, trash that Event card and carry out\nthe specified effect.\n8-4-3. When the effect of a card in the Leader area, Character area, or Stage area is\nactivated, carry out that effect.\n8-4-4. When “choose”, “select”, “up to” or another phrase indicating choice is included\nin the effect, the indicated cards, players, or other items are to be chosen when\nrequired to do so during the resolution of the skill.\n8-4-4-1. When the number to be chosen is specified, the player must choose as many\ncards, players, or other items as they can, up to the number specified.\nHowever, if “up to” is specified, the player may also choose 0.\n8-4-4-2. When the items to be chosen are unrevealed cards in a secret area, and the\nchoice requires information from the card, players cannot guarantee that the\nchosen card meets the required conditions. Thus, a player can decide not to\nchoose a card from a secret area, even if it may fulfill the conditions.\n8-4-4-3. When there are no specific instructions in the text for choosing a card, player,\nor other item, if the effect applies to a card, it indicates the card from which\nthe effect originates. If the effect applies to a player, it indicates the player of\nthat effect.\n8-4-4-4. When choosing cards from the deck, check the cards’ faces and choose the\nspecified cards.\n8-4-5. Auto effects that activate when a card is moved from one area to another will only\nactivate if the area the card is moved to is an open area. For example, this applies\nto cards with an [On K.O.] effect.\n8-4-6. When an effect is activated, it is activated and resolved taking into account any\ncontinuous effects that were resolved before it, as well as any valid permanent\neffects.\n8-5. Card Activation and Effect Activation\n8-5-1. Card activation and effect activation are different.\n8-5-2. Card activation refers to using an Event card from your hand.\n8-5-3. Effect activation refers to activating the effect of a card.\n8-5-4. For example, when a card reads “when you activate an Event”, it is referring to\ncard activation.\n8-6. Order of Effect Resolution\n8-6-1. When the activation timing of card effects of both the turn player and non-turn\nplayer is fulfilled at the same time, the turn player will resolve their effect first. If,\nin so doing, the activation timing of another card effect of the turn player is\n\n23\nfulfilled, the non-turn player will first resolve their card effect for which the\nactivation timing has been fulfilled. After that, the turn player will resolve their\ncard effect.\n8-6-1-1. If the activation timing of effects A and B of the turn player are fulfilled at\nthe same time, and effect A is resolved first, thereby fulfilling the activation\ntiming of effect C, effect C can be resolved following the resolution of effect\nB.\n8-6-2. If the activation timing of an effect is fulfilled during damage processing, the effect\ncan be activated after all damage processing has been resolved.\n8-6-2-1. If a Life card that is checked during damage processing has [Trigger], you\ncan temporarily suspend the damaging processing, reveal the card with\n[Trigger] and activate that [Trigger] effect instead of adding it to your\nhand.\n8.6.3. If the activation timing of an effect is fulfilled by activating a card or activating\nan effect, the effect can be activated after the resolution of the effect of the\npreviously activated card.\n9. Rule Processing\n9-1. Fundamental Rule Processing\n9-1-1. Rule processing refers to processing that is automatically carried out according to\nthe rules when specific events have occurred or are occurring during the game.\n9-1-2. Rule processing is immediately resolved when the corresponding event occurs,\neven if other actions are in the process of being carried out.\n9-2. Defeat Judgment Processing\n9-2-1. At the point when rule processing begins, if any player fulfills any of the defeat\nconditions below, all of those players lose the game.\n9-2-1-1. If either player’s Leader takes damage when that player has 0 Life cards, that\nplayer has fulfilled the defeat conditions for the game.\n9-2-1-2. If either player has 0 cards in their deck, that player has fulfilled the defeat\nconditions for the game.\n10. Keyword Effects and Keywords\n10-1. Keyword Effects\n10-1-1. [Rush]\n10-1-1-1. [Rush] is a keyword effect that allows a Character card to attack during the\nsame turn in which it is played.\n\n24\n10-1-2. [Double Attack]\n10-1-2-1. [Double Attack] is a keyword effect that, when damage is dealt to the\nopponent Leader’s Life by an attack from a card that has this effect, causes\n2 damage to be dealt to the Leader’s Life instead of 1.\n10-1-3. [Banish]\n10-1-3-1. [Banish] is a keyword effect that, when damage is dealt to the opponent\nLeader’s Life by an attack from a card that has this effect, causes a card in\nthe opponent’s Life area to be trashed instead of being added to their hand.\nAt this time, the [Trigger] is not activated.\n10-1-4. [Blocker]\n10-1-4-1. [Blocker] is a keyword effect with an activation timing that is fulfilled when\none of your other cards is being attacked, allowing you to activate it by\nresting this card during the Block Step. The [Blocker] card takes the place\nof the card being attacked.\n10-1-5. [Trigger]\n10-1-5-1. [Trigger] is a keyword effect that, on taking damage when there is a card in\nyour Life area with [Trigger], allows you to reveal that card and activate its\n[Trigger], instead of adding the card to your hand.\n10-1-5-2. You can also choose not to activate the [Trigger]. In such a case, add the\ncard to your hand without revealing it.\n10-1-5-3. If you take damage and activate a [Trigger], the card whose [Trigger] is\nbeing activated itself does not belong in any area while that [Trigger] is\nbeing activated. After finishing processing that activated [Trigger] effect,\ntrash that card unless otherwise specified.\n10-2. Keywords\n10-2-1. K.O.\n10-2-1-1. “K.O.” is a keyword that refers to a Character card being trashed on losing\na battle, or a Character card being trashed due to a card’s effect.\n10-2-1-2. As an instruction, “K.O.” means to place a Character card from the\nCharacter area into the owner of that card’s trash.\n10-2-1-3. [On K.O.] and effects that read “cannot be K.O.’d” or similar are only\nvalid when the card is K.O.’d by an effect or due to the result of a battle. If\na Character card is trashed due to some other method, it is not treated as\n“K.O.’d”.\n10-2-2. [Activate: Main]\n10-2-2-1. [Activate: Main] is a keyword indicating an effect can be activated during\n\n25\nthe Main Phase, except when in battle.\n10-2-3. [Main]\n10-2-3-1. [Main] is a keyword exclusively found on Event cards that can only be used\nduring the Main Phase, except in battle. It indicates that an effect can be\nactivated by using an Event card during the Main Phase, except in battle.\n10-2-3-1-1. As an exception, [Trigger] and other effects may also allow [Main] to\nbe activated in certain situations.\n10-2-4. [Counter]\n10-2-4-1. [Counter] is a keyword exclusively found on Event cards that can only be\nused during your opponent’s Counter Step. It indicates that an effect can\nbe activated by using an Event card during the Counter Step.\n10-2-4-1-1. As an exception, [Trigger] and other effects may also allow [Counter]\nto be activated in certain situations.\n10-2-4-1-2. [Counter] cannot be activated by effects unless the effect indicates\n“activate [Counter]”.\n10-2-5. [When Attacking]\n10-2-5-1. [When Attacking] is a keyword indicating that the activation timing is\nfulfilled and an effect activates when you declare an attack during your\nAttack Step (see 7-1-1.).\n10-2-6. [On Play]\n10-2-6-1. [On Play] is a keyword indicating that the activation timing is fulfilled and\nan effect activates when the card is played.\n10-2-7. [End of Your Turn]\n10-2-7-1. [End of Your Turn] is a keyword indicating that the activation timing is\nfulfilled and an effect activates at the End Phase of your turn (see 6-6-1-\n1.).\n10-2-8. [End of Your Opponent’s Turn]\n10-2-8-1. [End of Your Opponent’s Turn] is a keyword indicating that the activation\ntiming is fulfilled and an effect activates at the End Phase of your\nopponent’s turn.\n10-2-9. [DON!! xX]\n10-2-9-1. [DON!! xX] is a keyword indicating a condition that is satisfied when this\ncard originally has no or less than X number of DON!! cards and is given\nDON!! cards such that the number of DON!! cards given to it is X or higher.\n10-2-10. DON!! －X\n10-2-10-1. “DON!! －X” is a keyword indicating a condition requiring you to select\n\n26\na total number of DON!! cards equal to the value of X from your Leader\narea, Character area, and cost area, and return them to your DON!! deck.\n10-2-11. [Your Turn]\n10-2-11-1. [Your Turn] is a keyword indicating a condition that is satisfied during\nyour turn.\n10-2-12. [Opponent’s Turn]\n10-2-12-1. [Opponent’s Turn] is a keyword indicating a condition that is satisfied\nduring your opponent’s turn.\n10-2-13. [Once Per Turn]\n10-2-13-1. [Once Per Turn] is a keyword indicating an effect can only be activated\nand resolved once during that turn.\n10-2-13-2. Where there are multiple cards with the same effect, [Once Per Turn]\neffects can be activated and resolved once for each card.\n10-2-13-3. After a [Once Per Turn] effect has been resolved once, it cannot be\nactivated again, even if the conditions can be met during that turn. In\naddition, that card’s activation cost cannot be paid again during that turn.\n10-2-13-4. If a card is moved to another area after its [Once Per Turn] effect has been\nresolved once, if the card once again appears on the field, the [Once Per\nTurn] effect can be activated again because it is treated as a different card.\n(See 3-1-6.)\n10-2-13-5. If a [Once Per Turn] effect is activated and you become unable to pay the\nactivation cost while in the process of paying that activation cost, you may\nnot activate the [Once Per Turn] effect again even if the effect following\nthat activation cost did not resolve as result (see 8-3-1-3.).\n10-2-14. Trash\n10-2-14-1. “Trash” is a keyword indicating that a card is to be selected from the hand\nand placed in the trash.\n10-2-15. [On Block]\n10-2-15-1. [On Block] is a keyword indicating that the activation timing is fulfilled and\nan effect activates during the Block Step when you have activated your\n[Blocker] (see 7-1-2-2.).\n10-2-16. [On Your Opponent’s Attack]\n10-2-16-1. [On Your Opponent’s Attack] is a keyword indicating that the activation\ntiming is fulfilled when your opponent has declared an attack during their\nAttack Step (see 7-1-1.), and an effect activates after your opponent’s\n[When Attacking] and other Attack Step effects, if any, have been activated\n\n27\n(see 7-1-1-3.).\n10-2-17. [On K.O.]\n10-2-17-1. [On K.O.] is a keyword indicating that when the card is K.O.’d on the field,\nthe activation timing is fulfilled and you should check whether the\nactivation conditions have been met. If all the conditions have been met,\nthe effect is activated on the field. After that, the Character card with the\nactivated [On K.O.] effect is trashed, and the [On K.O.] effect is resolved\nwhile the card is in the trash.\n10-2-17-2. [On K.O.] is different from other auto effects because the Character card\nmoves areas between the effect is activated and resolved.\n11. Other\n11-1. Infinite Loops\n11-1-1. When carrying out some processing, there may be occasions where an action can\nbe or must be carried out infinitely. This is called an infinite loop, and one cycle\nof action from the start to the end of the loop is called a loop action. If such an\nevent occurs, follow the procedure below.\n11-1-1-1. If neither player can stop an infinite loop, the game ends in a draw.\n11-1-1-2. If only one player has the choice to stop the infinite loop during the loop\naction, that player declares how many times they wish to carry out the loop\naction. Carry out the loop action that many times and finish it at a timing\nwhen that player can choose to stop the infinite loop. The player cannot\nchoose to restart the loop even if the game is in exactly the same state (all\ncards in all areas are the same) as before the loop unless they are forced to\ndo so.\n11-1-1-3. If both players have the choice to stop the infinite loop during the loop action,\nthe turn player first decides how many times they wish to carry out the loop\naction. Next, the non-turn player decides how many times they wish to carry\nout the loop action. Carry out the loop action the fewer of these two times\nand finish it at a timing when the player who chose the fewer of these two\ntimes can choose to stop the infinite loop. The players cannot choose to\nrestart the loop even if the game is in exactly the same state (all cards in all\nareas are the same) as before the loop unless they are forced to do so.\n11-2. Revealing Cards\n11-2-1. When a card is required to be moved from one secret area to another secret area,\nsuch as “Add Monkey.D.Luffy from your deck to your hand”, the card being\n\n28\nmoved must always be revealed, even if there are no instructions to reveal it.\n11-2-2. When a card in a secret area is revealed by a card’s effect or cost, the card is set\nas unrevealed after that card’s effect or cost is resolved.\n11-3. Viewing Secret Areas\n11-3-1. Some effects enable players to look at secret areas. Unless otherwise specified by\nthe card, such effects apply only to the player of that effect.\n11-3-2. Cards remain in their original areas while being looked at.\n11-3-3. After looking at cards in secret areas, if there is nothing in the card text regarding\nactions to be taken in reference to the cards that were looked at, those cards must\nbe returned to their original area in their original state."

In addition to enforcing rules and policy, judges and other tournament officials should\neducate players about mistakes so that correct game play actions can be learned.\nLevel 2 Competitive and Level 3 Professional events are competitive and require the highest level of\nruling and policy enforcement.\n3.3 Tournament Formats\nThere are a variety of approved tournament formats that Tournament Organizers may select from\nwhen registering a tournament.\nTournament Format Definition\nConstructed Players bring a tournament-legal deck to play in a constructed\ntournament.\n\n15\nSealed Players will receive specific event product during the playersmeeting, and\nwill construct a legal deck from that product only.\nDraft Players will receive six booster packs from a booster box and will draft\ncards in pods of four. Following the draft, players will construct their deck\nfrom their drafted card pool.\n3.4 Tournament Structure\nTournament organizers may run events using single elimination or Swiss. Swiss + single elimination\ntop cut finals are used for Level 3 Professional events.\nTournament Structure Definition\nSingle-Elimination Half of the registered players are eliminated after each round,\nwith the losing players dropped from the event. The winners\nprogress to the next round. This continues until one player\nremains, who is declared the overall winner.\nSwiss Rounds Players are paired according to their win / loss records. Players\nare not eliminated when they lose. Instead, they will be paired\nagainst players with similar win / loss records for the remaining\nrounds of the event. Players may choose to drop from Swiss\nevents at any time by notifying the Scorekeeper prior to pairing\nof the following round.\nSwiss Rounds + Single\nElimination Top Cut Finals\nPlayers are paired according to their win / loss records. Players\nare not eliminated when they lose. Instead, they will be paired\nagainst players with similar win / loss recordsfor the remaining\nrounds of the event. Players may choose to drop from Swiss\nevents at any time by notifying the Scorekeeper priorto pairing\nof the following round.\nDepending on the number of participating players, a set number\nof players will progress to the Finals once there is only one\nplayer remaining in Swiss with only wins recorded. Players are\npaired off in their final ranking order – 1 v 8, 2 v 7, 3 v 6, 4 v 5,\netc., and proceed to elimination finals play.\n3.4.1 Single-Elimination\nSingle-Elimination tournaments determine the winner of the event by removing players from the\ntournament after they lose one match. The number of players in each round will be half the number\nof players in the preceding round. The tournament ends when one player is undefeated. That player\nis the winner of the event.\nSingle-Elimination Events run as follows:\n• Round 1: Players are assigned seeds at random and paired up. If players have played\nqualifying rounds, theirseeding is equal to their final placement in qualifying. The winner\nmoves on to the next match, while the losing player is eliminated from the tournament.\nIf the number of players enrolled in the event is not a power of 2, the highest-seeded players\nwill receive byes.\n• Subsequent Rounds: Players continue to be paired along brackets, with the winner of a\nmatch moving on and the loser being eliminated. Ultimately, only two players will remain,\nwith the winner of that Championship match becoming the winner of the tournament.\n3.4.2 Swiss\nThe objective of the Swiss pairing method is to determine a single winner by pairing players with\n\n16\nsimilar match records against each other until there is only one undefeated player.\nSwiss Eventsrun as follows:\n• Round 1: Players are paired randomly for the first round of play. Players receive 3 match\npoints for winning, 1 match point for a draw, and 0 match points for losing. If there is an odd\nnumber of players, a player will receive a bye. If a player wins by default, they receive 3\nmatch points.\n• Round 2: Players in the 1-0 (1 win) bracket are randomly paired against each other, while\nplayers in the 0-1 (1 loss) bracket are paired in the same manner. If there is an odd number\nof players, a player in the 1-0 bracket will be paired down with a random player in the 0-1\nbracket that they have not played before. If this leaves an odd number of players with 0\nwins, one player from that bracket will be assigned a bye.\n• Subsequent Rounds: Players continue to be paired randomly by their win-loss record until\nthe specified number of rounds have concluded, or one undefeated player has been\ndetermined.\n3.4.3 Swiss + Single Elimination Top Cut Finals\nThis format allows tournament organizers to run a number of Swiss rounds appropriate for the\nnumber of players participating, after which the top-ranked players are seeded into Single￾Elimination Finals brackets and play until only one player remains. That player isthe winner of the\ntournament.\nTournaments run using Swiss plus Single Elimination Top Cut Finals allow every player to participate\nin every round, while giving players without an undefeated record the opportunity to win the event.\n3.5 Match Structure\nDuring a tournament, a match will include a set number of games. The player who winsthe specified\nnumber of games wins the match.\nFor Professional level events, Tournament Organizers should use a best-of-one game match format\nduring qualifying rounds and Best-of-three match format for top cut.\nOnline Standard Match Structure\nBest-of-one Game Match\nNumber of game wins necessary: 1\nMatch Time: 35 minutes\nExtra Time: 5 minutes(for extra turns, etc.)\nStandard (Qualifying) Match Structure\nBest-of-one Game Match\nNumber of game wins necessary: 1\nMatch Time: 30 minutes\nExtra Time: 5 minutes(for extra turns, etc.)\nTop Cut Finals Match Structure\nBest-of-three Game Match\n\n17\nNumber of game wins necessary: 2\nMatch Time: 60 minutes\nExtra Time: 10 minutes (for extra turns, etc.)\nChampionship Top 2 Match Structure\nBest-of-three Game Match\nNumber of game wins necessary: 2\nNo time limit\n3.6 Number of Rounds\nThe number of rounds played in Swiss is based on the total number of players registered to play in\nthe event. Once the number of players who have won all their matches is reduced to 1, the\nqualifying rounds end and final player placement is calculated.\nTournamentOrganizers may not choose to deviate from the Tournament Rules Manual.\nTournament Organizers may run events with no Top Cut, provided that information is advertised\nbefore the start of the event.\nNumber of Participants ExpectedNumber of Swiss\nRounds\nPlayersQualifying for Top Cut\n(if applicable)\n4 – 8 3 rounds None\n9 – 16 4 rounds Top 2\n17 – 32 5 rounds Top 4\n33 – 64 6 rounds Top 8\n65 – 128 7 rounds Top 8\n129 – 256 8 rounds Top 16\n257 – 512 9 rounds Top 16\n513 – 1024 10 rounds Top 32\n1025-2048 11 rounds Top 32\nPlayers added to an event after registration closes as late entries will not impact the number of\nSwiss rounds or top cut calculations.\nThe number of Swiss rounds is designed, on a best-case basis, to have one undefeated player after\nthe last round has completed. The number of rounds should be announced before the beginning of\nthe first round; once announced, it cannot be changed. A variable number of rounds may be\nannounced instead, with specific criteria provided for ending the event.\nVariable Rounds Announcement Example: A Championship Level event has 205 players registered.\nThe Tournament Organizer may announce at the start of the event, “There are 205 players registered\ntoday, and we expect to play 6 to 8 rounds of qualifying. Qualifying rounds will end once there is one\nundefeated player left in the event, with only wins reported. At that point, qualifying will end and the\nTop 16 players progressing to Finals will be determined.”\n3.7 Publishing Tournament Information\nTournament Organizers, judges, players and spectators are free to publish details of play and / or\nresults of a tournament, subject to applicable laws in the region where the event was held.\nPlayer deck lists may be published by the Tournament Organizer at any time once the event has\nbegun, provided that this information is publicly accessible, that all player data is published at the\n\n18\nsame time, and that publication of this data provides additional value to those attending or\nwatching the event. Otherwise, this information should be kept confidential throughout the\nduration of the tournament.\nFor all 2-day events which have a top-cut playoff and are streamed, deck lists for the top-cut\nplayers must be published and distributed to all participating top-cut players by end of day on day\n1.\nTournament Organizers must provide deck lists to the Bandai global organized play team as part of\ntheir event reporting.\nBandai reserves the right to publish tournament information, including but not limited to deck lists,\nplayer reports, transcripts, audio and / or video recordings, awards, penalties or any other\ninformation related to the tournament.\nAttending a Bandai organized play event may lead to an attendee’s image and likeness being\nphotographed or recorded by or on behalf of Bandai. By entering or remaining at Bandai organized\nplay events, attendees grant Bandai, its premier tournament organizers, and approved media bodies\nto publish their name, image, likeness, deck list, methods of play, and written or oral statements in\nconnection with any still photograph, live or recorded video display, or other transmission or\nreproduction of the event, in whole or in any part.\n3.8 Stream Broadcasts of Match Play\nWhile attending Bandai organized play events, players may be instructed to play a feature match\nthat will be broadcast to a large audience and / or to online viewers. Players must comply with the\nTournament Organizer’s directions regarding match location. These matches may require additional\nequipment, including new card sleeves, the use of standardized play mats, apparel changes, or the\nuse of noise-cancelling headphones. Players must abide by these considerations.\nIt is not necessary that the stream casters are qualified judges. If a caster notices a violation of game\nrules, game state or Tournament Policy, they are required to notify a judge immediately. It is up to\nthe judge to determine whether it is appropriate to intervene.\nDue to the nature of streamed matches and a desire to not regulate feature matches more\nstringently than other matches during qualifying Swiss rounds, players should be aware that\npenalties earned but not applied during a match may be applied later upon subsequent review.\n3.9 Reporting Tournament Results\nIt isthe Tournament Organizer’s responsibility to report tournament resultsto Bandai within 48\nhours of the tournament’s completion.\n4.0 Tournament Play\n4.1 Gamesmanship\nPlayers are expected to behave in a respectful and polite manner towards all tournament attendees.\nIf you engage in unsporting conduct or behavior that endangers or detracts from the event, you may\nbe penalized, up to and including disqualification and removal from the venue.\n4.2 Tournament Registration\nPlayers need to register in order to participate in events. Check event information or contact the\nTournament Organizer if you need more information on registration times.\n\n19\nTo register, you’ll need government ID, your Bandai TCG+ account, and your pre-registration\ninformation or entry fee for the tournament.\nRegistration forms may also be required. Make sure your registration form is completed in full\nbefore lining up for registration.\n4.3 Special Assistance\nPlayers requiring special assistance at tournament events, including designated seating areas,\naccommodations for an aide orservice animal, approval to use electronic devices, etc.,should speak\nto the Head Judge and Tournament Organizer during the registration process. Players may also\ncontact the Tournament Organizer ahead of time to best ensure needs can be met.\n4.4 Deck List Submission\nTournament Organizers may require deck lists to be submitted for local events, but only if the\nrequirement is advertised prior to the start of the event.\nAll Championship level events require deck lists. Players may not use decks with cards that differ\nfrom those included in their deck list.\nA fully completed deck list, legibly written or printed, must be submitted in order to compete.\nYou may not use shorthand terms when writing out your deck list. Your deck list must include the\ncard’s collector number and its full name to ensure a clear and accurate deck list.\nPlayersthat fail to follow deck list rules may receive penalties. It is ultimately a player’sresponsibility\nto ensure they accurately, clearly, and completely communicate the contents of their deck.\nTournament Organizers should collect Deck Lists at the start of the player meeting or before Round\n1 commences. Once a deck list has been submitted, it may not be altered or changed unless\nrequested by a judge.\nThe Tournament Organizer and / or Head Judge has the authority to check player decks (a “deck\ncheck”) to determine whether or not they are appropriate. Deck checks should be carried out by\nFloor Judges where possible. Deck checks should be performed at any time the tournament\nprogresses from Swiss to single elimination, as well as randomly throughout Swiss rounds. Deck\nchecks should be performed on at least 10 percent of decks over the course of the tournament.\nWhen performing deck checks, judges should assure the deck presented matches the submitted\ndeck list. They should also assess the cards quality, sleeves quality, and the contents of the deck\ncontainer presented (No cards/items that can be confused with game elements are allowed to be\nplaced in the deck container).\n4.5 Shuffling\nDecks must be shuffled thoroughly using accepted shuffling methods (riffle, Hindu, etc) in order to\nsufficiently randomize their contents. Both players must shuffle their decks in a manner that is\nvisible to their opponents. This must be done at the start of every match, and whenever a game\nmechanic requires you to shuffle your deck.\nYou cannot check or arrange any cards while shuffling.\nYoumay not pre-sort your deck without thoroughly shuffling afterwards.\nAfter players have shuffled their decks, it should be presented to the opponent to either cut\n(separating the deck into multiple, smaller piles which are then rearranged to form a single deck\nagain) or shuffle. No additional randomization may be done to the deck after this.\n\n20\nWhen you present your deck to your opponent, you agree that you have sufficiently shuffled and\nrandomized your deck contents, your deck is legal, and that it matches your submitted deck list\nregistration form.\nPlayers are strongly encouraged to shuffle opponent’s decks at Level 3 Professional events.\nSometimes, a player may carry out a shuffle in a way that seems suspicious. If you feel a player’s\ndeck has not been sufficiently randomized; you may request a judge carry out a shuffle or observe\nyour opponent shuffling. The judge will determine the necessary course of action.\nAll shuffles, searches and acts of adding specific cards from your deck to your hand must be carried\nout in an expedient manner. Resolving card search and shuffle effects should take no longer than a\nminute from the activation of a power to its full resolution.\nA judge may penalize a player for the amount of time taken to resolve an action if deemed\nnecessary.\n4.6 Determining Starting Player\nAfter players have shuffled both of their decks thoroughly, players should use a random method to\ndecide which player is the starting player.\nPlayers may roll a die, flip a coin, play Rock-Paper-Scissors, etc.\nThe winner chooses who goes first.\nIn all Top-Cut play-off and championship matches, the player with the higher standing after Swiss\nrounds will choose who goes first for the first game.\nIn a best-of-three game match, the player who loses the preceding game chooses whether to go first\nin the next game.\nIf a game loss has been awarded for the first game of a match, the starting player of the second\ngame is determined randomly.\n4.7 Game Area Layout\nWhile game mats are not required, players are responsible for placing all cards according to the\nlayout established by the Game Area Play Sheet.\nSpecific locationsinclude:\n• Deck\n• DON!! deck\n• Hand\n• Trash\n• Leader area\n• Character area\n• Stage area\n• Cost area\n• Life area\nYou may not create your own game area layout. It is possible to modify the layout to accommodate\nphysical requirements. If you need to modify the game area layout, you must notify your opponent\nand ensure it is obvious to all tournament officials.\n\n21\nThe position of cards must be maintained as they were originally placed on the game area, except\nwhen directed otherwise by a card effect.\nEach deck should be oriented in a north / south direction, with the short sides of the cards facing\neach player.\nCards in a player’s Life Area must be spaced out in a way that ensures a player, their opponent,\njudges and tournament staff can see at a glance how many Life cards a player has remaining. The\nLife cards must be on the opposite side of the play area from the player’s deck and trash.\nPlayers should always play with both hands above the table. The cards in a player’s hand should\nshow card backs orsleeves clearly visible to the opponent. Players are not allowed to play with their\nhands below the table or concealed from an opponent.\nPlayers should not place unused cards in a nearby location (inside clothing, in a deck case, on the\ntable) during a match. Cards not registered on a deck list should be kept inside a bag or other\ninaccessible location during tournament play.\nIf a card must be rotated to indicate a specific effect, it must be rotated to either 90 or 180 degrees.\nPlayers should not stack cards within their Life area in a way which obscures how many Life cards\nthey have left.\nDo not move cards between areas unless a card effect directs you to do so.\nAvoid placing your hand close to other specified areas.\n4.8 Note Taking\nPlayers are not allowed to take notes in official Bandai organized play events. Players should not\nhave paper or other stationery not used for game purposes nearby during game play.\nYou may consult a copy of your Deck List between matches (not in between games) to ensure you\nhave restored your deck to the registered state.\n4.9 Official Errata Document\nPlayers are allowed to have a printed copy of the official Bandai errata document nearby during\ngame play to consult for information regarding the errata of certain cards. This document may not\nhave any notes on the paper and the note taking policy also applies to this document.\nJudges and opponents may request to see the document during game play.\n4.10 Game State\nGame state refers to all elements of the game – cards, life, deck, hand, trash, turns, phase, etc. Both\nplayers are responsible for maintaining the proper game state by clearly communicating with their\nopponent.\nPlayers are required to divulge any and all information that may be required to maintain a legal and\ncorrect game state.\nThe game state can be damaged by illegal actions, missed triggers, etc.; rendering it either reparable,\nirreparable, or accepted. Whether or not a game state is reparable or irreparable will mean the\ndifference between a Warning and a Game Loss.\nIf both players can provide clear information and a judge is able to determine a way to fix or rewind\nthe game state, it is reparable. The game should be repaired as far as possible and play should\n\n22\ncontinue.\nSometimes, even if a game state has been damaged, it has happened too far back to easily and fully\nrepair, and does not create a significant advantage for the player at fault.\nIn this case, the game state is accepted by both players, and play will continue.\n• A game state can be considered reparable even if not every error can be rewound.\n• A game loss is not an appropriate penalty for a reparable game state, unless it is applied as a\npenalty for repeated previous infractions.\n• If both players share fault in an irreparable game state that should be awarded a game loss,\ndetermine which player is most at fault and penalize that player with a Game Loss. The\nopponent should receive a Warning.\n• Irreparable game statesshould not result in restarting a game or match.\n• If a player has damaged the game state due to an illegal action or missed auto, and\ngameplay can be rewound to the point of that illegal action, it will be rewound even if the\nopponent would gain an advantage from information that was previously Private\nKnowledge.\n4.11 Public Knowledge\nThe following information is considered to be public knowledge, unless a card effect states\notherwise:\n• The number of cards in a player’s hand;\n• The number of cards in a player’s deck (thisincludes main and DON!! deck);\n• The number and names of cards in a player’s trash area;\n• The number of Life cards remaining;\n• Information printed on a specific card mentioned by name or otherwise clearly described;\n• Which cards have been played during the current turn.\nPlayers must answer questions involving the above topics truthfully. Players may not refuse to\nanswer questions about information that is public. Lying about or refusing to answer questions\nabout public knowledge may result in disqualification.\n4.12 Private Knowledge\nThe following information is considered private information, unless a card effectstates otherwise:\n• The cards in the main deck;\n• What cards are in the Life area;\n• Which cards are in a player’s hand;\n• Which cards are in an opponent’s hand;\n• Which cards were played or activated during the previous turn, unlessthere is an active\ngameplay effect.\nPlayers may not answer questions about any game state information considered private knowledge.\nGiving false or misleading information about private knowledge, or intentionally revealing\ninformation considered private knowledge, may result in a disqualification penalty.\n4.13 Life Area / Hand / Deck Verification\nWith the exception of areas targeted by a search effect, you may not search any of your opponent’s\nprivate knowledge areas, such as hand, deck, or life area, unless you are directed to do so by a card\n\n23\neffect.\nJudges may not be asked to search or verify your opponent’s hand, deck or life area unless there is\nevidence your opponent may be cheating or that there may be a valid deck-related issue.\n4.14 Appeals\nPlayers have the right to appeal rulings to the Head Judge of the tournament if they disagree with a\nfloor judge’s ruling.\nPlayers may not appeal a floorjudge’s ruling until after the floor judge has issued the ruling.\nPlayers must respectfully inform the floor judge that they wish to appeal the ruling issued. If you\naccept the floor judge’s ruling, you cannot ask to appeal that ruling later.\nThe Head Judge’s ruling is final, and cannot be appealed.\n4.15 Conceding a Game or Match\nPlayers may concede a game or match at any time up until the point that the game or match has\nconcluded. Once a game or match has concluded, you may not concede or ‘give the win’ to an\nopponent. This means once a game or match result has been reached (win, lose, or draw), the result\ncannot be changed. Players who change the result of a game or match are guilty of Altering Game /\nMatch Results and will be penalized appropriately.\nPlayers may not offer or accept any form of compensation in exchange for conceding a game or\nmatch. Players who concede in exchange for compensation are guilty of accepting bribery. Offering\nor accepting a bribe is against the Tournament Rules Manual policy and both players will be\ndisqualified from the event.\n4.17 Random Outcome\nPlayers or tournament officials may not randomly determine the outcome of a match by any means.\nFailing to observe this rule will result in disqualification from the event.\n4.18 Intentional Draws\nPlayers are not allowed to intentionally declare a draw match, even with both players’ consent.\nIf players are found to have agreed to an intentional draw, or play in a manner that means the\noutcome will result in a draw without trying their best to obtain a result, they will be subject to\npenalty.\nMatches cannot end in a draw, outside End of Round procedures.\n5.0 Reporting Match Results\n5.1 Reporting the Match Result\nBoth players are responsible for accurately reporting the result of a match. Level 3 Professional\nevents may provide printed match result slips for you to report match results. Other events may\nrequire you to verbally confirm the match result with the scorekeeper.\nThe winner of each round is responsible for ensuring the round result is reported in a timely fashion\nfollowing the conclusion of the match. The winner is responsible for submitting the match result via\nTCG+ or verbally reporting the results to the scorekeeper. Failure to do so in a timely manner may\nresult in penalties.\nPlayers should consult a Tournament Official if they are unsure of the proper procedure for\n\n24\nreporting match results.\nMatch results cannot be altered once they have been submitted. Players should verify the match\nresult carefully before submitting it and, if a discrepancy is seen once reported, should be reported\nto the TO immediately.\n5.2 End of Round Procedures\nSometimes a match may not finish prior to time being called for the round. Both players are\nresponsible for noting who is the active player when time is called.\nPlayers who need assistance with End of Round procedures should raise their hand and call for a\njudge. The judge should be notified the game is ongoing and whose turn it is. The judge should\nensure both players understand the End of Round procedures, and may stay to supervise.\nIf time is called while players are in between games, compare the number of games won by each\nplayer. If they have both won the same number of games, the match is declared a draw. If one\nplayer has won more games than the other, that player is declared the winner of the match.\nIf time is called while players are in the middle of a game, the current game must have a decision of\nwin, loss, or draw.\nTo resolve the current game, playersfollow the following steps:\n1. The player with the most game wins is declared the winner of the match.\n2. If tied, the current active player plays out their turn. This is considered turn 0. Players\nplay an additional three turns, with the current (active) player’s turn becoming turn 0.\nThe second player’s turn will be considered turn 1, followed by the first player’s turn 2,\nand then back to the second player for the third and final turn\n3. If neither player has won at the end of extra turns, the player with the highest number\nof Life cards wins.\n4. The player with the higher number of cards remaining in their deck wins.\n5. The player with more Characters in their Character area wins.\n6. If both players have the same number of Characters in their Character area, the player\nwho last removed a card from their Life area wins.\nA time limit of 5 minutes is applied to extra turns to ensure the ongoing smooth operation of the\ntournament event. A draw will be declared if time expires with no clear winner after performing the\nprior steps.\nIf time expires during extra turns and the active player has a card attacking, complete the attack\nthrough the End of Battle.\nIf time expires during extra turns and the active or non-active player has an effect which has activated\nbut not resolved, complete that effect and any subsequent effects which occur due to that effect.\nGame play should be monitored by judges during thistime. The guidelines for Slow Play should be\nstrictly observed, and penalties handed out for any players found to be playing slowly.\nSingle Elimination Rounds and Top Cut Finals\nDraws are not permitted during single-elimination rounds, including top cut finals.\nIf there is a tie due to all players fulfilling loss conditions simultaneously, the current turn-player\nloses the game, and the opponent is declared the winner.\nIf time is called while players are in between games, compare the number of games won by each\n\n25\nplayer. If one player has won more games than the other, that player is declared the winner of the\nmatch. If they have both won the same number of games, the match will continue by starting\nanother game and proceed immediately to the steps below.\nWhen time is called while players are in the middle of a game, determine a winner of the match\nusing the following steps:\n1. The player with the most game wins is declared the winner of the match.\n2. If tied, the current active player plays out their turn. This is considered turn 0. Players\nplay an additional three turns, with the current (active) player’s turn becoming turn 0.\nThe second player’s turn will be considered turn 1, followed by the first player’s turn 2,\nand then back to the second player for the third and final turn\n3. If neither player has won at the end of extra turns, the player with the highest number\nof Life cards wins.\n4. The player with the higher number of cardsremaining in their deck wins.\n5. The player with more Characters in their Character area wins.\n6. If both players have the same number of Characters in their Character area, the player\nwho last removed a card from their Life area wins.\nIn an event with a set end time, if the winner has not been decided by that time, no result will be\ndetermined, and the match may be declared a null match without a winner.\nThe Championship Match\nTime limits do not apply for the Championship match of an event. The match is played until there is\na clear winner.\n5.3 Match Pairings\nAfter each round is completed, the Tournament Organizer should pair the next round and post the\npairings.\nPlayers must be given a reasonable amount of time to report any errors with their win / loss records\nand find their seats.\nOnce the round hasstarted, pairings cannot be changed. To aid the accurate and timely reporting of\nmatch results, match result slips may be utilized at all Level 3 Professional events.\nThe Tournament Organizer can use their discretion to decide whether or not to re-pair a round if a\nplayer’s win / loss record isincorrect. The Scorekeeper can fix the error before the round starts and\nre-pair, or wait until the round starts before fixing the match record. The player’s pairing in the next\nround will be correct.\nPlayers should note that win / loss records cannot be altered after a second subsequent round has\nbeen paired. For example, round 2 results cannot be altered after round 4 is paired. Players\ntherefore have one full round to report any win / loss record errors to the Scorekeeper or Head\nJudge. Match records are noted on the posted pairings on TCG+ and the match result slips (if\napplicable). Tournament Organizers should use both of these tools to remind players to regularly\ncheck their win / loss record.\n5.4 Tie Breakers and Calculating Final Placement\nOfficial events use a tie-breaker system to determine how players are ranked when both have the\nsame number of match wins.\n\n26\nPlayers earn points based on how well they perform during a match.\nMatch Outcome Points Awarded\nWin 3\nBye 3\nDraw 1\nLoss 0\nPlayers are ranked first on how many points they have accumulated during the course of the event.\nIn the event of a tie, placement is determined by the process below:\n1. Comparing Average Match Win Rate – calculate the average match win rate of the 2\nplayers (excluding byes) and divide the value by the number of tournament rounds they\nparticipated in. The player with the higher final value ranks above others.\n2. Comparing Average Match Win Rates for the Players’ Opponents – calculate the average\nmatch win rate for the opponents of each player. The player with the higher final value\nranks above others.\nIn extremely rare occasions, players may finish a tournament with identical tie-breakers, leaving\nthem tied for finalstanding. If time permits, the players should play another match to determine a\nwinner.\nIn cases where there is no time for an additional game or match, the Head Judge should do the\nfollowing:\n1. If the players have already played against one another in the tournament event, the\nwinner of that match will take the higher final standing.\n2. If the tied players have not played against one another in the tournament event, the\nHead Judge may use a random method such as a die roll, raffle, coin toss, etc to\ndetermine the finalstanding. Please note thisis different to randomly determining the\noutcome of a match.\nCalculating Average Values\n1. Player Average Match Win Rate = theirmatch points(excluding match points from byes)\n/ participated rounds(excluding byes) x 3\n2. Average Match Win Rates for a Player’s Opponent = the total of the entire opponent’s\nvalues from (1)/ number of games the player participated in.\nNumbers under 0.33 are treated as 0.33.\n5.5 Earning Invitations or Byes\nPlayers who finish in the top percentage of a tournament sometimes earn the right to progress (an\ninvitation) to a higher-level tournament event. This right is non-transferable.\nAttempting to transfer thisright to another player, and / or falsely claiming to have received this\nright may result in tournament disqualification or suspension upon further investigation.\n6.0 Dropping Out\nPlayers who wish to forfeit or drop from the tournament must notify the Scorekeeper prior to the\ngeneration of the next round’s pairings. Once a round list has been posted, or any time before a\nmatch is about to begin, if a player decides to drop, they are considered to have conceded the match\nin progress.\n\n27\nPlayers who drop from the event and fail to correctly notify the Scorekeeper in a timely fashion are\nineligible to receive commemorative prizes and other items.\n7.0 Tournament Penalties\nPolicy documents are intended to educate players on expected behavior at tournament events.\nPolicy documents may notserve as a resource for persons to attempt to take advantage by “rule￾sharking” or otherwise attempting to influence the decisions of judges and tournament officials.\nRule sharking is defined as using rules and policy to attempt to create an advantage, instead of\nensuring fair gameplay.\nIncidents or infractions may occur during the course of an event that may require the need to issue a\npenalty. This chapter outlines how to resolve infractions, the types of penalties, how to assign them\nappropriately, and a guideline for situations that may arise that require an infraction recorded.\nIf a player violates any rules or regulations, a judge must issue the player with an appropriate\npenalty.\n7.1 Determining an Infraction\nA judge must investigate first, then determine the infraction, and only then apply an appropriate\npenalty, detailed later in this section. Judges should not reverse engineer penalties.\n• All persons involved should explain what happened, and answer honestly any questions a\njudge may have.\n• The judge will explain the situation, and determine if an infraction occurred.\n• If an infraction occurred, the judge will explain the infraction and apply the appropriate\npenalty.\n• If no infraction occurred, the judge will explain why. Investigations\nfor more serious infractions should be conducted in private.\n• Some severe infractions may also be explained in private to the person committing the\ninfraction.\n• Not every situation that occurs is appropriate for public knowledge. A judge’s decision to\naddress a situation in private must be respected by other players, spectators, uninvolved\njudges and tournament officials.\n• The Head Judge’s decision is final.\nOnce an infraction has been identified, the judge will ask the player if they have received any other\npenalties for this same type of infraction during the course of the tournament event.\n• Penalties may need to be upgraded if this is a repeated infraction. If it is a repeat infraction,\nthe Head Judge should be notified.\n• Players are required to answer this question honestly. Lying to a tournament official is\nagainst tournament policy, and will be penalized.\n• If this is a first-time infraction, the judge will briefly educate the player in regardsto the\ninfraction, why it occurred, and what the penalty is.\nPlay will continue if applicable.\nIf the infraction occurred during a match and the judge call took longer than 2 minutes, an\nappropriate time extension should be noted by the judge using the method determined for the\nevent by the Head Judge or Tournament Organizer to ensure all are aware. Judges should always\n\n28\nnote down the time at which they take a judge call, to ensure an appropriate time extension is\nprovided.\n• Time extensions are given after the judge call has been fully resolved, including any appeals.\n• Time extensions are given only for actual time lost during a match.\n• Time extensions must be reported to the Scorekeeper.\n• Time extensions are not given when there is a Game Loss penalty applied.\n• Multiple time extensions may be given to the same match.\nJudges must record the penalty using the appropriate method deemed by the Tournament Organizer\nor Head Judge in the following order:\nPlayer’s Name / Infraction / Penalty Assigned / Reason Why / Name of Judge Who Issued Penalty\nIf the infraction did not occur during a match, the judge should provide all the details to the\nScorekeeper so the infraction can be tracked appropriately.\nPenalties acquired on Day 1 will carry over into Day 2.\n7.2 Types of Penalties\nBelow is a list of penalties in order of severity from lowest to highest. Head Judges cannot issue a\npenalty other than those listed below. All infractions must be recorded by all judges and\nTournament Organizers so that accurate assessments on player behavior can be made.\n1. Caution: A Caution is the lowest level of penalty that can be issued to a player. These types\nof penalties are designed to let a player know that they have made an error and to help\ncorrect their gameplay forthe future. Typically, minimal effects on the game state may have\noccurred which can be easily fixed. Cautions are issued on the spot and are recorded per\nplayer. If a player repeats the same infraction, the Caution penalty can be upgraded to a\nWarning.\n2. Warning: A Warning can be issued where an obvious error has occurred that hasresulted in\nan outcome which is favorable for a player based on the game state, or the game state may\nnot be able to be repaired fully to the same extent if the infraction did not occur. Warnings\nmay also be issued for actions that impede the running of an event. This can also be used as\nthe next step for a continued infraction of the same nature, which may be of a lesser\nconsequence to the overall gameplay. If a player repeats the same infraction, the Warning\npenalty can be upgraded to a Game Loss, Match Loss or Disqualification.\n3. Game Loss: A Game Loss is a higher form of penalty indicating that a major error in\ngameplay has occurred, or the regulations of the event have not been met, which has\nresulted typically in an unfair advantage for one player, or caused a direct detriment to\nanother player. If the player is currently between games or matches, the player losesthe\nnext game they were assigned to play.\n4. Match Loss: A Match Loss penalty should be reserved for the most extreme cases where the\ngame has reached a state where no repair can be made, and the opposing player is at a\nsevere disadvantage based on the error made. These typically involve a situation where one\nplayer gains an unfair advantage over a player, and the situation cannot be rectified through\nany other course of action. A player issued a Match Loss loses the current match. If the\nplayer is currently between matches, the player loses the next match they were assigned to\nplay. If the player is in a match they are clearly about to lose, the judge may choose to apply\nthe Match Loss penalty to the player’s next match.\n\n29\n5. Disqualification: A Disqualification is one of the most extreme forms of penalties that can be\nissued, and should be reserved for instances where the tournament integrity as a whole has\nbeen affected by the actions of the player and / or major examples of unsportsmanlike\nconduct. Players who receive this penalty are issued a Match Loss for the current round (if in\nplay) and dropped from the remainder of the tournament, with no prizes or rewards to be\nissued. Players who receive a Disqualification are recorded for future reference and reported\nto Bandai.\n6. Suspension: A Suspension is a penalty issued to players who have seriously damaged the\nintegrity of an event or events, or may have received multiple higher-level penalties over a\nnumber of events that indicate that behavior has not changed. Suspensions can be issued\nnot only against current players but all participants in an event. Persons who receive a\nSuspension are recorded for future reference. A person issued a Suspension loses their\ncurrent match (if applicable) and is immediately removed from the event, with no prizes or\nrewards to be issued. Suspensions last a specific length of time specified by Bandai.\nSuspended persons cannot enter official Bandai events for the duration of the Suspension.\nThe suspended player, along with the length of their Suspension, will be posted on the\nofficial One Piece Card Game home page. If a player issued a Suspension changes their\nBandai TCG+ account, if it is discovered that their original account was issued a Suspension,\nthe new account is immediately issued a new, lengthier Suspension.\n7.3 Assigning Penalties\nIt is advised that all penalties more severe than a Warning be issued only after reporting infractions\nto the Head Judge. The Head Judge should handle assigning penalties of Match Loss or greater.\nThe issuing of penalties should occur in a way that is respectful of involved parties. When issuing a\npenalty, the judge must explain the infraction and how to resolve the situation to all related players.\nIf the head judge decides to alter this process, they must explain the penalty and why they chose to\nalter the standard procedure. Careful consideration must be given for any deviation from the\nguidelines to ensure the integrity of the event and not bring untoward blame to Judges or the\nTournament Organizers.\nDepending on the infraction, the description of the penalty will provide advice on how to resolve the\ninfraction. These procedures are designed to prevent judges from being criticized for unfair or\npreferential judgement. The issuing of penalties should be accompanied by quoting the relevant\npolicy.\nJudges must always consider the current game / game state and who will gain benefit as a result of\ncarrying out penalty procedures. The procedures exist to ‘correct’ certain situations, and favoring a\nplayer (even if unintentional) or being careless when considering the game state can result in further\nissues. If a single mistake causes multiple infractions, a penalty should be issued for the most severe\ninfraction.\nJudges and Tournament Organizers are to record any penalty during a tournament to ensure that\nthere is consistency with regards to how penalties are issued.\nJudges must record the penalty using the appropriate method deemed by the Tournament Organizer\nor Head Judge in the following order:\nPlayer’s Name / Infraction / Penalty Assigned / Reason Why / Name of Judge Who Issued Penalty\nPenalties may be issued to person(s) who are not participating in the event. The penalties are\n\n30\ndesigned to be applied to players, but other event personnel (spectators, staff, judges) can also be\nresponsible for infractions. Penalties can still be issued to a player even if they have already forfeited\nan event.\nThe finalsay on all penalties at events are at the discretion of the Head Judge.\n7.4 Examples of Infractions\nInfractions can occur in a number of ways, with differing levels of severity. Based on the level of\ncompetition, a Judge can increase the level in which a penalty is issued but never reduce. The types\nof infractions that can occur are:\n7.4.1 Game Play Error\nThese can be wrong or inaccurate actions by a player that are contrary to the official rules of the\ngame. It is assumed that errors of this nature are accidental, but a judge may use their discretion to\nincrease the infraction to a higher punishment if they feel the error was deliberate.\n1. Failing to Observe Game Rules\nAn infraction in which a player failed to observe a rule or misinterpreted it. Note this is\nseparate from errors resulting from players forgetting to resolve automatic actions.\nPenalty: Warning\nResolution: Issue a Warning to the player(s) responsible for the action. Efforts must be made\nto reverse the game state to before the error occurred, provided a considerable amount of\ntime has not elapsed. If this is not possible, reverse as far as possible as to not adversely\naffect one player over another. Continue the game from this point.\n2. Forgetting to Resolve Automatic Actions\nAn infraction in which a player proceeds with the game after failing to resolve an automatic\neffect.\nPenalty: Warning\nResolution: Issue a Warning to the player/s responsible for resolving the automatic action,\nand carry out the effect from the closest checkpoint (based on the judge’s determination).\nHowever, if the effect was a voluntary action that included text such as “you can”, treat the\neffect as if the player chose not to carry out the action.\n3. Looking at Unnecessary Cards\nAn infraction in which a player looks at a card/cards which should not have been visible to\nthem. This also includes voluntarily revealing your hand, or looking at your opponent’s hand\nbecause they revealed their hand. These actions make tournament environments less\nenjoyable and should not be encouraged.\nPenalty: Warning\nResolution: Issue a Warning to the player responsible for the infraction. If the card has only\nbeen revealed to the player who made the infraction, reveal it to their opponent as well. The\njudge then confirms which cards require being placed in set orders. Cards which can have no\nset orders are shuffled together, while cards that must be placed in a set order are returned\nto their appropriate locations.\nExamples:\n• A player accidentally looked at 4 cards when resolving an effect that asked them to\nlook at the top 3 cards of their deck.\n• A player’s Life cards are accidentally turned face-up.\n\n31\n4. Invalid Cardsin Secret Areas\nAn infraction in which there is an incorrect number of cards in a Secret Area, or cards in an\ninvalid state in a Secret Area.\nPenalty: Warning\nResolution: Issue a Warning to the player(s) responsible forthe action that caused the\ninvalid cards to be in a secret area. If it is clear (to the Judge’s satisfaction) which card/s are\nincorrectly located in a secret area, those cards must be returned to their correct area. For a\ncard from deck, it is returned to the top of the deck. If the card is from the Life , it is shuffled\nback into the life area. If it is not clear (to the Judge’s satisfaction) which card/s are\nincorrectly located in a secret area, the Judge is to randomly select the number of cards\nincorrectly held, and return them to the appropriate secret area and sufficiently randomize\nthat area again.\nExamples:\n• A player accidentally drew 3 cards instead of 2.\n• A player accidentally added a card from their deck to their hand directly when they\nshould have revealed it first.\n7.4.2 Event Errors\nThese are errors which occur when player(s) do not adhere to the Floor Rules as outlined in this\ndocument. If a Judge determines that the error was deliberate, they may escalate the infraction\nrecorded.\n1. Tardiness\nAn infraction in which a player was not seated at the beginning of a match or did not\ncomplete a specific action within the given time limit.\nPenalty:\nWarning – if a player arrives within 5 minutes of match start.\nGame loss – if a player is 5 or more minutes late.\nMatch Loss – if a player is 10 minutes late.\nResolution: Issue a Warning if the player is seated and ready to play within 5 minutes of the\nround start time. Issue a Game Loss if a player is more than 5 minutes late. Issue a Match\nLoss if the player is not seated within 10 minutes of the round start time.\nExamples:\n• A player is not seated and ready to play until 7 minutes after the start of a match.\n• A player sat in the wrong seat and started a match against the wrong opponent. In\nthis case, it may be most appropriate to repair the two matches impacted and give a\nwarning to the players.\n2. Referring to information outside of the Game\nAn infraction in which information was given to a player from outside the game or actively\nsought by a player using outside sources of information.\nPenalty: Game Loss - Match Loss\nResolution: If the information is received during a match, issue a Match Loss to the player\nreceiving the information if it has been actively sought. A Game Loss may be issued if it is\nunclear whether a player actively sought the information out. Issue a Match Loss to the\nplayer/s providing any information to a player who is currently playing a match. If the person\nwho gave information is a spectator, a judge may bar that person from spectating for the\n\n32\nduration of the tournament. During a match refers to the span of time starting from the\nposting of pairings to the actual end outcome is reached in a match. At any other time,\nplayers can receive information from any source.\nExamples:\n• A player asks for, or actively receives advice from another player orspectator.\n• A spectator gives advice to a player without their consent.\n• A player has notes written down on their official errata document\n3. Slow Play\nAn infraction in which a player unintentionally slows down the pace of a game, either during\nthe match or extra time. If a judge confirms a player deliberately sought to delay the game\nand use the time limit to their advantage, they may escalate the infraction.\nPenalty: Warning – Game Loss\nResolution: Issue a Warning to the player responsible for the infraction. A judge will\ndetermine if the appropriate amount of time has been taken to complete an action, or make\na decision to further the game. If there is continued need for a judge to ensure a player\ntakes an appropriate amount of time on decisions or actions during a match, they may\nescalate the penalty to a Game Loss.\nExamples:\n• An opponent calls a judge over and asks them to observe slow play due to the\nopponent taking an unnecessary amount of time considering their next action.\n• A player takes an excessive amount of time to shuffle their deck.\n• A judge determines players are taking an unnecessarily long time to further the\ngame state.\n• A player thinks about their next play for more than a minute, slowing the game\ndown significantly.\n• A player takes an extensive amount of time looking at an official errata document,\nslowing down the game significantly.\n4. Deck Error: Illegible Deck Lists\nAn infraction in which a deck list submitted cannot be read, or is incomplete in a way that it\nmakesthe task of checking the list during a deck check a difficult task. However, this should\nnot be confused with an incorrect or absent number of cards which is covered under\n“Incorrect Number of Cards”.\nPenalty: Warning\nResolution: Issue a Warning to the player with the illegible deck list. The player should be\ngiven sufficient time to complete the deck list in a way that makes it easier for Judges to\ncheck for errors. If this error is found during the event, players should be asked to complete\nthe amendments between rounds. If this causes them to be late to their next round, apply\nthe infraction process for “Late Arrival to a Match”.\nExamples:\n• A player’s list cannot be read to determine all cards are included in the deck.\n• A player’slist is missing card numbers or card names but is otherwise legal.\n5. Deck Error: Incorrect number of cardsin Deck / Deck List\nAn infraction in which a player’s deck list, or deck, contains the incorrect number of cards\neither above or below the amount required in the main and DON!! deck.\nPenalty: Game Loss\n\n33\nResolution: Issue a Game Loss to the player, and have them correct the error either in the\ndeck or on their deck list so that the two are made valid.\nExamples:\n• A player’s deck contains over or under the required 50 card limit for the main deck,\nbut their deck list contains a valid number of cards.\n• A player’s deck list contains over or under the required 50 card limit for the main\ndeck, but their deck contains a valid number of cards.\n• A player’s deck and deck list contains only 49 cards.\n6. Deck Error: Incorrect cardsin deck / deck list\nAn infraction in which a player’s deck does not match the submitted deck list at the time of a\ndeck check.\nPenalty: Game Loss\nResolution: Issue a Game Loss to the player, and have them correct the error.\nExamples:\n• An opponent’s cards are found in a player’s deck at the start of a new game.\n7. Illegal cards in deck\nAn infraction in which the deck produced by the player includes cards that are either invalid\nfor deck construction, or are contrary to the rules of the Game (i.e. unofficial cards).\nPenalty: Game Loss\nResolution: Issue a Game Loss to the player found with incorrect cards within their deck. If\nthis is found during a match, the Game Loss is issued for the current game and the player is\ngiven time to correct their error if possible. If the error is found between rounds, the Game\nLoss applies to the next match, and the player must correct the deck before play begins in\nthe next round. Follow the steps for “Late arrival to a Match”.\nExamples:\n• A player has cardsthat are hot stamped that have not been officially released by Bandai.\n8. Communication\nAn infraction in which a lack of communication adversely influences gameplay. Both players\nhave the responsibility to play the game with a common understanding of the events\noccurring within the game. If either player fails to declare their actions sufficiently, that\nplayer is treated as if they are obstructing the game.\nPenalty: Warning\nResolution: Issue a Warning to the player responsible for the violation. Then, the judge\nrewinds the game state back to a point with as few issues as possible. After explaining the\nsituation to the players, let them continue playing the game from that point on. The judge\nmay only rewind the game back to a former state if there is no way to correct the current\nsituation as it is.\nExamples:\n• A player realizes they misunderstood how a card or cards were supposed to be\nplayed earlier in the game.\n9. Marked Cards\nAn infraction in which cards or sleeves are clearly marked and can be visually distinguished\nby looking at the card backs or fronts. Care should be taken to view how these cards could\n\n34\nbe seen when in a secret area.\nPenalty: Warning – Game Loss\nResolution: Issue a Warning if when the cards are examined, one card can be easily\ndistinguished from the next when in a secret area. However, if there is a pattern to the\nmarked cards (i.e. if they are all the same type, or could be important for gameplay), a\nhigher penalty should be given. The player may be required to acquire new sleeves or swap\nout damaged sleeves with non-damaged sleeves. Consideration for the level of penalty will\nbe made by the Head Judge taking all factors into account. If the Marked Cards are\nintentional, consider the infraction as “Cheating”.\nExamples:\n• Some of the sleeves were damaged. The cardsin the damaged sleeves appear to be\nrandom.\n10. Insufficiently shuffling / non-randomized Deck\nAn infraction in which a deck wasinsufficiently shuffled.\nPenalty: Warning\nResolution: Issue a Warning to the player responsible for the violation. The judge thoroughly\nshuffles the player’s deck. The procedure must be carried out in front of the opponent\nmultiple times, with different types of shuffles.\nExamples:\n• A player only shuffles their deck once with a Hindu shuffle.\n• A playershuffles their deck insufficiently with a pile shuffle.\n• A player gives an already shuffled deck to the opponent after sitting down.\n11.

Given the online nature of\nevents, and additional technical and communication challenges that may be experienced by players,\nwe recommend extending standard best-of-3 match times to allow for additional time.\nBest-of-one Game Match\nNumber of game wins necessary: 1\nMatch Time: 35 minutes\nExtra Time: 5 minutes(for extra turns, etc)\n8.3 Deck Registration\nPlayers must submit a photo of their physical deck to the Tournament Organizer, together with a\nname and date stamp. The Tournament Organizer should also collect an electronic deck list link.\nDuring the event, Judges should complete random deck checks to ensure the physical deck being\nutilized matches the one registered.\n8.4 Player Setup\nPlayers must compete using a webcam and their real physical cards via the published Discord server.\nTechnical Requirements\n• Webcam (1080p recommended; 720p minimum)\n• Computer\n• Microphone\n• Dedicated Playing Space (if using a playmat, please use one with darker colors to enable\ncards to be more easily seen by your opponent).\nSet Up\n1. Set up your dedicated playing space where your cards will be displayed for your opponent.\n2. Adjust your webcam’s position so your playing space is shown in full. You must capture the\nentire game area, including your Deck, DON!! deck, Trash, Leader, Character, Stage, Cost,\nand Life areas. Note: your face does not need to be captured on the webcam stream!\n3. When pairings are posted, join the voice channel that correlatesto your assigned table.\n4. When you join the voice chat and meet your opponent, there is an option in Discord to begin\nvideo chat. Press it, and your webcam will be enabled so your opponent can see your video\nfeed.\n\n38\n5. You must have your microphone enabled so both players can easily communicate with each\nother and with any judges that enter the table channel.\n6. All relevant cards must be kept on the video feed at all times. This includes your hand.\n7. Make sure to keep your hand over the table so that cards do not fall to the flop.\n8. All shuffling must take place on camera, otherwise your deck will not be considered\nrandomized. When your opponent would normally cut your deck, you must ask how they\nwould like it to be cut.\n8.4 Setup Examples\nExamples of poorsetups\nThissetup does notinclude\nthe deck and trash clearly\nThis setup shows the hand\nin frame, butit is being held\nin a way that shows private\ninformation to the player’s\nopponent. Players should\ntake care to make sure the\nangle they are holding their\nhand at does not give away\nsecret information.\n\n39\nThe hand is obscured, and\ncurrent life totals aren’t\nclear.\nThissetup’slife area layout\nis incorrect. It is set up in a\nway in which there is no\nclear top/bottom card and\nno specific order.\nThis setup does not follow\nthe correct area layout\ndescribed in the officialrule\nmanual.\nEx. The DON!! area is above\nand below the character\nand area. The character\narea and leader are in the\nsame row. The life area isin\nan incorrect layout\naltogether.\nExamples of correctsetups\nThe layout matches the approved layout in the official rule manual. The hand is in the picture but\nsecret to the opponent.\nThis is another example of a correct layout. Thissetup utilizes dice to keep track of hand and life\ncount. This is not required but suggested for online play"
